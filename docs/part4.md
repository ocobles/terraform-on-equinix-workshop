# Conclusion

Thank you for participating in the workshop! Let's recap some of the key takeways that we've learned:

* How to structure a terraform project for successful Day-2 operations
* Deploy an Equinix Metal device with terraform
* Using tfvars to keep secrets out of the configuration and make the configuration reusable

## Next Steps

* Convert this project to a reusable [Terraform Module](https://github.com/equinix-labs/equinix-labs/blob/main/terraform-module-standards.md).
* Learn how to use Terraform to manage Equinix Fabric and Network Edge resources by trying out the [available examples](https://github.com/equinix/terraform-provider-equinix/tree/master/examples).
